# CPS410HomecomingSimulator


## Abstract
Our project is a homecoming simulator with the goal to create a simulation of a football stadium as well as players and the ball in Unity. The main aspect of the project is focused on the ball itself. There is a new ball called the Wilson X Connected football that has a bluetooth chip inside that is used to track the statistics of the ball. Using this ball we would be tracking the speed of the ball, distance thrown, spiral/roll speed, and the pitch and roll. Before we get to the ball itself, we plan to create a simulation of the ball within Unity that uses this telemetry data for virtual and physical simulation. Our first goal is to project accurate estimations on football motion virtually within Unity. Our second goal is to output this data to a physical motion simulator.
